The more vigorously you dance, the better your scores are! Flail those arms and legs!
Dont cheat ... dansa can tell when you've stopped dancing!
If you turn vibration on ... dansa can notify you (via a vibe) when you score a nice point or two .

Final Note
==========================

Dansa is magical . But not totally magic. The score you get is based a simple algorithm tracking your hand movement in space. Future versions of Dansa will include improved versions of the dance tracking algorithms .
Remember to delete the readmeimages folder on your local repository when running the code (to reduce app size).
